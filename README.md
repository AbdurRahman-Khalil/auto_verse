# 🚗 AutoVerse: A Car Manufacturing Company

A clean, minimalistic and responsive landing page for a car manufacturing company(fictional).  

This project was created as a personal refresher to revisit the fundamentals of web development with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript after working extensively with modern tools like ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white&style=flat) and ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TailwindCSS-38B2AC?logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white&style=flat) and other related tools.
